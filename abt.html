      <H2> AgroBot
        Who We Are</h2>
        <p>  AgroBot is a pioneering agri-tech company focused on revolutionizing agriculture through the power of artificial intelligence and robotics. We believe that technology can empower farmers to achieve higher efficiency, better crop yields, and sustainable practices â€” all while reducing manual labor and minimizing resource wastage.</p>
        <h2>Our Vision</H2>
            To create a future where every farmer, regardless of location or scale, has access to intelligent, affordable, and automated farming tools. We envision smart farms where machines and AI systems work alongside humans, ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture for generations to come.</P><br>
    <P>What We Do
        We develop AI-driven robots and intelligent systems that support farmers in managing their day-to-day operations. Our key offerings include:
      <u1>  
       <li> Pest Monitoring Bots</li>
        Equipped with cameras and sensors, these bots roam the fields and detect pest infestations early. The AI model identifies threats and alerts the farmer in real time.<br>
        
    <li>Soil Health Monitoring Systems</li>
        Using advanced soil sensors, our devices measure moisture levels, nutrient content, and pH balance â€” helping farmers apply the right amount of fertilizers and water.<br>
        
        <li>Irrigation Alert Systems</li>
        Our AI learns crop patterns, weather forecasts, and soil moisture data to notify farmers about the best time to water crops â€” saving both water and energy.<br>
        
        <li>Farm Surveillance & Maintenance</li>
        Our robots keep watch over large farms, ensuring safety, efficiency, and timely action. We also provide regular software updates and hardware maintenance.<br>
        
        <li>Market Intelligence</li>
        Our platform tracks crop prices, weather trends, and demand-supply dynamics to help farmers make smarter selling decisions.</P><br>
